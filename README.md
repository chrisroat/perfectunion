# About

Over 22 million comments were submitted to the FCC on the
topic of Net Neutrality.  The vast majority of these were
pre-fabricated comments, submitted by both real people and
automated "bots".  Only a small fraction were comments that
were uniquely created, likely by a person with a very real
personal stake in the FCC's decisions on Net Neutrality.

After removing pre-fabricated comments, short submissions (less than
140 characters) and filings with inconsistent addresses (e.g. zip
code in wrong state), the resulting 502,667 submissions can be
viewed on [Perfect Union](https://perfectunion.chrisroat.net/) based on the
Congressional District the filer resided in.

## The internet made this possible

- All the comment data was downloaded from the [FCC's Electronic Comment
  Filing System](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/)
  
- Thanks to [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org) and
  [Ragtag](https://ragtag.org) for their interest in coming together to analyze
  the comment data.  The pre-fabricated templates have been identified and
  removed using code in Ragtag's 
  [fccforensics](https://github.com/RagtagOpen/fccforensics) repository.  Read a
  [blog post](https://medium.com/ragtag-notes/bot-or-not-verifying-public-comments-on-net-neutrality-8c77ee54a02e)
  about that work.

- Mike Bostock's 
  [D3+SVG Congressional District Map](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4657115)
  was the starting point for the visualization work.
